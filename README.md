# HB Bookstore Management Software
The problem addressed involves creating a comprehensive software system for Hypothetical Books (HB), a large independent bookstore, to manage its inventory, sales, and store arrangement efficiently. Key features of the system include:

Book Management: Administrators can add books using ISBNs, with the system fetching basic details. They can also manually fill in additional information. There are optional features for automatic pricing and genre identification.

Financial Tracking: The system facilitates recording wholesale book purchases and sales reconciliations. It also generates reports on revenue, costs, and profits.

Buyback Tracking: It tracks book buybacks, offering statistics to aid in purchasing and buyback decisions.

Book Metadata: The system includes book cover images and metadata, displaying them as needed.
Shelf Layout Assistance: With knowledge of book sizes, the system aids in store shelf layout planning.

Data Import/Export: Users can export and import book information via CSV for bulk operations like purchase orders and sales reconciliations.
Backup and Restoration: IT operations staff can restore system states from backups, with clear documentation on the procedure.

User Access Levels: Multiple users can access the system, with administrators having "read-write" access and normal users having "read-only" access.

Related Books Identification: The system identifies related books, like different editions or translations.

Display Planning: Users can design bookcase layouts for prominent displays.

Inventory Logging: Administrators can log inventory changes, including loss or theft.

Sales Integration: Book sales data is automatically recorded from Point Of Sale systems, with manual sales reconciliations in special cases.

Planogram Generation: The system can generate planograms for bookcase layouts.

Subsidiary Integration: It can query inventory from HB's acquired subsidiary and provide an API for inventory queries by HB's parent store after its acquisition.
